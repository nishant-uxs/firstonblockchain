# NFT Diplomas: Issue Verifiable Diplomas as NFTs for Graduates

## Vision

The **NFT Diplomas** project envisions a future where traditional paper-based diplomas are replaced by blockchain-based, verifiable digital certificates. By issuing diplomas as NFTs (Non-Fungible Tokens), educational institutions can provide students and graduates with verifiable credentials that are secure, transparent, and easily transferable. This system eliminates diploma fraud, reduces administrative burden, and allows employers and institutions to easily verify the authenticity of a graduate's credentials on the blockchain.

### Why NFT Diplomas?
- **Authenticity**: Diplomas are stored on the blockchain, making them tamper-proof and easily verifiable.
- **Decentralized**: Removes reliance on centralized authorities for diploma issuance and verification.
- **Ownership**: Graduates have full control over their digital diploma NFTs.
- **Transferability**: Graduates can share and prove their qualifications anywhere online or offline through a verified blockchain record.

## Future Goals

### Short-Term Goals
- **Institutional Partnerships**: Engage with educational institutions to issue NFT diplomas directly from their systems.
- **User-friendly Interfaces**: Develop easy-to-use interfaces for students and administrators to mint, transfer, and verify diplomas.
- **Public Verification System**: Build a public verification platform where anyone can input a wallet address or NFT ID to verify a diploma's authenticity.

### Long-Term Goals
- **Cross-chain Compatibility**: Expand the project to other blockchain ecosystems like Ethereum, Solana, and Binance Smart Chain, enabling institutions and users to choose their preferred network.
- **Smart Contract Upgrades**: Include features such as NFT metadata for detailed information on the degree (e.g., major, GPA, date of graduation) and course history.
- **Integration with Employment Platforms**: Partner with job platforms such as LinkedIn and Indeed to integrate verifiable credentials, allowing instant verification of qualifications during hiring processes.
- **Automated Issuance and Notifications**: Automate diploma issuance upon graduation and implement notifications for degree updates or further certifications.

## Smart Contract Overview

The smart contract for NFT Diplomas is written in **Move**, the programming language of the Aptos blockchain. Below is an overview of the contract's key components.

### **Contract Name**: `Diploma::NFTDiploma`

### 1. **Struct: `DiplomaNFT`**
This struct defines the NFT that represents the diploma. Each diploma contains:
- **creator**: The address of the institution or authority issuing the diploma.
- **graduate_name**: The name of the graduate, stored as a vector of bytes.
- **issue_date**: The date the diploma was issued, represented as a Unix timestamp (u64).

```move
struct DiplomaNFT has key {
    creator: address,
    graduate_name: vector<u8>,
    issue_date: u64,
}
```

### 2. **Function: `mint_diploma`**
This function allows the authorized account (an institution or admin) to mint a new diploma NFT. The NFT is linked to the graduate by storing the name and issue date.

#### Parameters:
- `account`: The signer's account that is issuing the diploma.
- `graduate_name`: The graduate's name (in vector<u8> format).
- `issue_date`: The date the diploma was issued.

```move
public fun mint_diploma(
    account: &signer,
    graduate_name: vector<u8>,
    issue_date: u64
) {
    let owner_address = signer::address_of(account);
    let diploma_nft = DiplomaNFT {
        creator: owner_address,
        graduate_name,
        issue_date,
    };

    move_to(account, diploma_nft);
}
```

#### Behavior:
- Mints a new `DiplomaNFT` and moves it into the account of the issuer (the educational institution).

### 3. **Function: `transfer_diploma`**
This function allows the current owner of the diploma to transfer the NFT to another address, which can be a graduate or another institution.

#### Parameters:
- `account`: The signer's account that is transferring the diploma.
- `_recipient`: The recipient's address to whom the diploma NFT will be transferred.

```move
public fun transfer_diploma(account: &signer, _recipient: address) acquires DiplomaNFT {
    let owner_address = signer::address_of(account);
    let diploma_nft = move_from<DiplomaNFT>(owner_address);

    move_to(account, diploma_nft);
}
```

#### Behavior:
- Transfers the `DiplomaNFT` from the issuer or current holder to a new owner.

## How to Deploy and Use the Contract

### Step 1: Deploying the Contract
To deploy this contract on the Aptos blockchain:
1. Install the necessary development environment for Aptos.
2. Compile the Move module and deploy it using the Aptos CLI:
   ```bash
   aptos move compile
   aptos move publish
   ```

3. After deployment, you can interact with the contract using the Aptos SDK or Aptos CLI.

### Step 2: Minting a Diploma
To mint a diploma, you can call the `mint_diploma` function by passing the graduate's name and issue date. This will create an NFT diploma and store it in the issuer's account.

### Step 3: Transferring a Diploma
Once the diploma is minted, it can be transferred using the `transfer_diploma` function. The institution can transfer the diploma to the graduate's account.

## Testing and Interaction

You can test the deployed smart contract by:
1. Using the Aptos CLI for function calls.
2. Using a frontend dApp built with Aptos SDK to call the contract functions from a web interface.
3. Integrating with wallets like **Martian** or **Petra** to sign and submit transactions.

## Conclusion

The **NFT Diplomas** project is a step towards making credential verification secure, decentralized, and globally accessible. With the increasing need for verifiable digital assets and credentials, NFT diplomas on the blockchain offer a revolutionary way to authenticate educational achievements, making verification simple and foolproof.

By implementing this system, we aim to empower educational institutions and graduates alike, providing secure and easily transferable credentials for the digital age.
